Here, we report that the antifibrotic drug 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone (pirfenidone, PFD) elicits growth-inhibitory effects and reduces TGF-beta2 protein levels in human glioma cell lines. This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",

We investigated the effects of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-FU plus uracil (UFT) with or without leucovorin on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat colorectal carcinomas. Thirty-week administration of UFT with or without leucovorin markedly suppressed both colorectal carcinogenesis and tumor growth, resulted in the increase of thymidylate synthase inhibition and the decrease of thymidine kinase activity in the tumor cells.

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many \"sensory compounds\" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.",

The norepinephrine transporter (NET) regulates adrenoreceptor signaling by controlling the availability of synaptic norepinephrine (NE), and it is a direct target for some classes of antidepressant drugs. NET levels are normal in dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice that lack NE, demonstrating that the NET does not require endogenous NE for appropriate regulation under physiological conditions. In contrast, tyrosine hydroxylase knockout (Th -/-) mice that lack both NE and dopamine (DA) have reduced levels of NET, suggesting that it is down-regulated by a complete absence of catecholamines and not NE per se. Chronic treatment with the NET inhibitor, desipramine (DMI), reduced NET levels in both control and Dbh -/- mice, demonstrating that NE is not required for the regulation of NET by antidepressant drugs. There are some qualitative and quantitative differences in the down-regulation of the NET by catecholamine depletion and DMI treatment, suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved.",

In order to define the biochemical mechanism involved in the hepatoprotection afforded by Sch B pretreatment, we examined the activity of DT-diaphorase (DTD) in hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated rats. Hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated (a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days) rats showed a significant increase (25%) in DTD activity. The increase in DTD activity was associated with the enhanced rate of menadione elimination in the hepatocyte culture. The ensemble of results suggests that the ability of Sch B pretreatment to enhance hepatocellular DTD activity may at least in part be attributed to the protection against menadione hepatotoxicity.",

High throughput screening led to the identification of a novel series of quinolone \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. Optimization of an HTS hit (1) led to 4-phenyl-1-(quinuclidin-3-ylmethyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one, which was found to be potent and selective. Poor brain penetrance in this series was attributed to transporter-mediated efflux, which was in turn due to high pKa. A novel 4-fluoroquinuclidine significantly lowered the pKa of the quinuclidine moiety, reducing efflux as measured by a Caco-2 assay.",

Proline oxidase (POX), a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, catalyzes the rate-limiting oxidation of proline to pyrroline- 5-carboxylate (P5C). Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability.

The concentration of estramustine phosphate required to inhibit the assembly or to induce the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules is markedly dependent upon the microtubule protein concentration. Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate.

Proline oxidase (POX), a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, catalyzes the rate-limiting oxidation of proline to pyrroline- 5-carboxylate (P5C). Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

The DOTA linkage was installed at a mechanism-based strategic location in the pantoprazole molecule to minimize a possible negative effect of the structural modification on the drug.

Using radioligand binding techniques, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) for 37 neuroleptics and one metabolite of a neuroleptic (haloperidol metabolite) for the human serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters with [3H]imipramine, [3H]nisoxetine, and [3H]WIN35428, respectively. Among neuroleptics, the four most potent compounds at the human serotonin transporter were triflupromazine, fluperlapine, chlorpromazine, and ziprasidone (K(D) 24-39 nM); and at the norepinephrine transporter, chlorpromazine, zotepine, chlorprothixene, and promazine (K(D) 19-25 nM). At the human dopamine transporter, only pimozide (K(D) = 69+/-3) ziprasidone (K(D) = 76+/-5) had notable potency. These data may be useful in predicting therapeutic and adverse effects, including drug interactions of neuroleptics.",

Thalidomide--removed from widespread clinical use by 1962 because of severe teratogenicity--has anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects, including the inhibition of TNF alpha. It has returned to practice as an effective oral agent in the management of various disease states including erythema nodosum leprosum, for which it was FDA-approved in 1998, and more recently certain malignancies, including multiple myeloma. Whilst the mechanism of action of thalidomide remains incompletely understood, considerable insight has been generated by extensive preclinical studies in multiple myeloma. Moreover, clinical trials both as a single agent and in combination have confirmed benefit in relapsed and refractory disease. Thalidomide's role in treating newly diagnosed patients is currently under study and it is now established as an important therapeutic option in the treatment of multiple myeloma.",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many \"sensory compounds\" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.",

Nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with netilmicin and tobramycin ( 17 % vs 11 % ) . ototoxicity occurred in four ( 9.5 % ) of 42 netilmicin and piperacillin and in 12 ( 22 % ) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin -treated patients. of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms , three of four netilmicin and piperacillin -treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin -treated patients. the number of greater than or equal to 15-db increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-db changes ( increases and decreases ) was significantly lower in netilmicin and piperacillin - vs tobramycin and piperacillin -treated patients ( 18 of 78 vs 67 of 115 ) . we conclude that aminoglycoside -associated ototoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with netilmicin than with tobramycin .",

Proline oxidase (POX), a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, catalyzes the rate-limiting oxidation of proline to pyrroline- 5-carboxylate (P5C). Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

ATRA and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and some skin diseases. Many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. Among them, tamibarotene (Am80) is an RARalpha- and RARbeta-specific (but RARgamma- and RXRs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is effective in the treatment of psoriasis patients and relapsed APL. Experimentally, this compound is also active in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis.

Human placental 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5----4-ene isomerase (3 beta-HSD) purified from human placenta transforms C-21 (pregnenolone and 17 alpha-hydroxy pregnenolone) as well as C-19 (dehydroepiandrosterone and androst-5-ene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol) steroids into the corresponding 3-keto-4-ene-steroids and is thus involved in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. Trilostane, epostane and cyanoketone are potent inhibitors of 3 beta-HSD with Ki values of approximately 50 nM. 4-MA, a well known 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, is also a potent inhibitor of 3 beta-HSD with a Ki value of 56 nM. Synthetic progestin compounds such as promegestone and RU2323 show relatively strong inhibitory effects with Ki values of 110 and 190 nM, respectively. Cyproterone acetate, a progestin used in the treatment of hirsutism, acne and prostate cancer as well as norgestrel and norethindrone that are widely used as oral contraceptives also inhibit 3 beta-HSD activity at Ki values of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 microM, respectively.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

The DOTA linkage was installed at a mechanism-based strategic location in the pantoprazole molecule to minimize a possible negative effect of the structural modification on the drug.

Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the \u03b1(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.",

We searched ER\u03b1 cistromes of MCF-7 breast cancer cells for previously unrecognized ER\u03b1 targets and identified proto-oncogene PIM-1 as a novel potential target gene. We show that the expression of PIM-1 is induced in response to estradiol in MCF-7 cells and that the induction is mediated by ER\u03b1-regulated enhancers located distally upstream from the gene. In keeping with the growth-promoting role of the PIM-1, depletion of the PIM-1 attenuated the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells, which was paralleled with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor CDKN1A and CDKN2B expression. Analysis of PIM-1 expression between invasive breast tumors and benign breast tissue samples showed that elevated PIM-1 expression is associated with malignancy and a higher tumor grade. In sum, identification of PIM-1 as an ER\u03b1 target gene adds a novel potential mechanism by which estrogens can contribute to breast cancer cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

The carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (gamma-carboxylase) is an essential posttranslational modification required for the biological activity of a number of proteins, including proteins involved in blood coagulation and its regulation. Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the gamma-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx(+/-) intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx(-/-) offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)-deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for gamma-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.",

The concentration of estramustine phosphate required to inhibit the assembly or to induce the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules is markedly dependent upon the microtubule protein concentration. Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate. It is proposed that two molecules of estramustine phosphate interact with each of the three tubulin-binding sites of MAP2 and inhibit the MAP2:tubulin interaction by neutralising two highly conserved basic residues.",

Functional activity of neurotransmitter receptor and their sensitivity to regulation are altered in DM. We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of curcumin in glutamate mediated excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex of streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. Gene expression studies in diabetic rats showed a down regulation of glutamate decarboxylase mRNA leading to accumulation of glutamate. Radioreceptor binding assays showed a significant increase in \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors density which was confirmed by immunohistochemical studies. Decreased glutathione peroxidases gene expression indicates enhanced oxidative stress in diabetic rats. This leads to decreased expression of glutamate aspartate transporter, which in turn reduces glutamate transport. All these events lead to excitotoxic neuronal death in the cerebral cortex, which was confirmed by the increased expression of caspase 3, caspase 8 and BCL2-associated X protein. Curcumin and insulin treatment reversed these altered parameters to near control. We establish, a novel therapeutic role of curcumin by reducing the glutamate mediated excitotoxicity in cerebral cortex of diabetes through modulating the altered neurochemical parameters.",

Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the gamma-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx(+/-) intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx(-/-) offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)-deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for gamma-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.",

We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

Proline oxidase (POX), a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, catalyzes the rate-limiting oxidation of proline to pyrroline- 5-carboxylate (P5C). Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Increased incidence of prostate cancer has been reported in men exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that influences its transcriptional activity. We investigated the influence of TCDD on prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-tumor prostate cells (PNT1A) on 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone-activated ARs containing CAG repeats within normal length range (16, 22, and 28). The AhR target gene CYP1A1 mRNA expression was induced by TCDD, but was not affected by the AR CAG length. TCDD had no effect on AR activity in PC-3 cells, whereas the shortest AR variant was induced by TCDD in PNT1A cells. In conclusion, the CAG length dependent effect of TCDD on AR activity in PNT1A, but not in PC-3 cells, indicates as a cell-specific effect of TCDD on AR activity.",

Increased incidence of prostate cancer has been reported in men exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that influences its transcriptional activity. We investigated the influence of TCDD on prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-tumor prostate cells (PNT1A) on 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone-activated ARs containing CAG repeats within normal length range (16, 22, and 28). The AhR target gene CYP1A1 mRNA expression was induced by TCDD, but was not affected by the AR CAG length. TCDD had no effect on AR activity in PC-3 cells, whereas the shortest AR variant was induced by TCDD in PNT1A cells. In conclusion, the CAG length dependent effect of TCDD on AR activity in PNT1A, but not in PC-3 cells, indicates as a cell-specific effect of TCDD on AR activity.",

In order to define the biochemical mechanism involved in the hepatoprotection afforded by Sch B pretreatment, we examined the activity of DT-diaphorase (DTD) in hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated rats. Hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated (a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days) rats showed a significant increase (25%) in DTD activity. The increase in DTD activity was associated with the enhanced rate of menadione elimination in the hepatocyte culture. The ensemble of results suggests that the ability of Sch B pretreatment to enhance hepatocellular DTD activity may at least in part be attributed to the protection against menadione hepatotoxicity.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Human placental 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5----4-ene isomerase (3 beta-HSD) purified from human placenta transforms C-21 (pregnenolone and 17 alpha-hydroxy pregnenolone) as well as C-19 (dehydroepiandrosterone and androst-5-ene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol) steroids into the corresponding 3-keto-4-ene-steroids and is thus involved in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. Trilostane, epostane and cyanoketone are potent inhibitors of 3 beta-HSD with Ki values of approximately 50 nM. 4-MA, a well known 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, is also a potent inhibitor of 3 beta-HSD with a Ki value of 56 nM. Synthetic progestin compounds such as promegestone and RU2323 show relatively strong inhibitory effects with Ki values of 110 and 190 nM, respectively. Cyproterone acetate, a progestin used in the treatment of hirsutism, acne and prostate cancer as well as norgestrel and norethindrone that are widely used as oral contraceptives also inhibit 3 beta-HSD activity at Ki values of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 microM, respectively.",

Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the \u03b1(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to evaluate gastrointestinal (GI) structure and functions in humans. Despite filling the viscus lumen with a contrast agent, visualization of the viscus wall is limited. To overcome this limitation, we de novo synthesized a conjugate that covalently combines a Gd-based MRI contrast agent, encaged with a chelating agent (DOTA), with pantoprazole, which is a widely used proton pump inhibitor that binds to proton pumps in the stomach and colon. The DOTA linkage was installed at a mechanism-based strategic location in the pantoprazole molecule to minimize a possible negative effect of the structural modification on the drug. It is anticipated that by defining the wall of the stomach and colon, this compound will facilitate functional MRI of the GI tract in humans.",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many \"sensory compounds\" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.",

Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many \"sensory compounds\" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.",

Whole-exome analysis of the Pik3ca(H1047R)-driven mammary tumors identified multiple mutations, including Trp53 mutations that appeared spontaneously during the development of adenocarinoma and spindle cell tumors.

Retinoid is a collective term for compounds which bind to and activate retinoic acid receptors (RARalpha, beta, gamma and RXRalpha, beta, gamma), members of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The most important endogeneous retinoid is all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) which is an RARalpha, beta and gamma ligand. ATRA and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and some skin diseases. Many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. Among them, tamibarotene (Am80) is an RARalpha- and RARbeta-specific (but RARgamma- and RXRs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is effective in the treatment of psoriasis patients and relapsed APL. Experimentally, this compound is also active in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On this background, possible application of retinoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases was discussed. In particular, Th1 dominant autoimmune diseases may be the targets of the retinoids.",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many \"sensory compounds\" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.",

We searched for inhibitors of HDC from the ethyl acetate extract of the petal of Filipendula ulmaria, also called meadowsweet. Rugosin D, rugosin A, rugosin A methyl ester (a novel compound), and tellimagrandin II were the main components; these 4 ellagitannins exhibited a non-competitive type of inhibition, with K(i) values of approximately 0.35-1 \u03bcM.

To overcome this limitation, we de novo synthesized a conjugate that covalently combines a Gd-based MRI contrast agent, encaged with a chelating agent (DOTA), with pantoprazole, which is a widely used proton pump inhibitor that binds to proton pumps in the stomach and colon. The DOTA linkage was installed at a mechanism-based strategic location in the pantoprazole molecule to minimize a possible negative effect of the structural modification on the drug. It is anticipated that by defining the wall of the stomach and colon, this compound will facilitate functional MRI of the GI tract in humans.",

Osteoclasts are involved in the catabolism of the bone matrix and eliminate the resulting degradation products through transcytosis, but the molecular mechanism and regulation of transcytosis remain poorly understood. Upon differentiation, osteoclasts express vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is essential for vesicular storage and subsequent exocytosis of glutamate in neurons. VGLUT1 is localized in transcytotic vesicles and accumulates L-glutamate. Osteoclasts secrete L-glutamate and the bone degradation products upon stimulation with KCl or ATP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. KCl- and ATP-dependent secretion of L-glutamate was absent in osteoclasts prepared from VGLUT1-/- knockout mice. Osteoclasts express mGluR8, a class III metabotropic glutamate receptor. Its stimulation by a specific agonist inhibits secretion of L-glutamate and bone degradation products, whereas its suppression by a specific antagonist stimulates bone resorption. Finally, it was found that VGLUT1-/- mice develop osteoporosis. Thus, in bone-resorbing osteoclasts, L-glutamate and bone degradation products are secreted through transcytosis and the released L-glutamate is involved in autoregulation of transcytosis. Glutamate signaling may play an important role in the bone homeostasis.",

These agents were applied to whole-cell voltage-clamped ganglion cells from an isolated, superfused mouse retina preparation. DCPG reduced OFF-ganglion cell excitatory currents, whereas AZ enhanced the peak excitatory currents in ON-, OFF-, and ON-OFF-ganglion cells. The effects on ganglion cell inhibitory currents were more varied. The effects of the allosteric modulator were stronger for bright stimuli than for dim stimuli, consistent with receptor stimulation by endogenous glutamate being stronger during bright light stimulation and with mGluR8 receptors mainly being localized away from glutamate release sites, immuno-labeled with VGLUT1. The differential sensitivity of ganglion cell light responses to DCPG and AZ supports multiple sites where mGluR8 modulates the light responses of ganglion cells.",

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate.

Proline oxidase (POX), a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, catalyzes the rate-limiting oxidation of proline to pyrroline- 5-carboxylate (P5C). Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Cyproterone acetate, a progestin used in the treatment of hirsutism, acne and prostate cancer as well as norgestrel and norethindrone that are widely used as oral contraceptives also inhibit 3 beta-HSD activity at Ki values of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 microM, respectively.",

Due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas.

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many \"sensory compounds\" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.",

This is distinct from Rock inhibitors based on non-amino acid derived quinazolinones, where high selectivity against PKA could be obtained.(22) The inhibitors presented here in some cases possessed sub-nanomolar inhibition of Rock, nanomolar potency in ppMLC cell based assays, low to fair cytochrome P-450 inhibition, and good human microsomal stability.",

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a bioactive component extracted from honeybee hive propolis. Our observations indicated that CAPE treatment suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation of TW2.6 human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells dose-dependently. CAPE treatment decreased G1 phase cell population, increased G2/M phase cell population, and induced apoptosis in TW2.6 cells. Treatment with CAPE decreased protein abundance of Akt, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, phospho-Akt Ser473, phospho-Akt Thr 308, GSK3\u03b2, FOXO1, FOXO3a, phospho-FOXO1 Thr24, phospho-FoxO3a Thr32, NF-\u03baB, phospho-NF-\u03baB Ser536, Rb, phospho-Rb Ser807/811, Skp2, and cyclin D1, but increased cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Overexpression of Akt1 or Akt2 in TW2.6 cells rescued growth inhibition caused by CAPE treatment. Co-treating TW2.6 cells with CAPE and 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for oral cancers, exhibited additive cell proliferation inhibition.

To overcome this limitation, we de novo synthesized a conjugate that covalently combines a Gd-based MRI contrast agent, encaged with a chelating agent (DOTA), with pantoprazole, which is a widely used proton pump inhibitor that binds to proton pumps in the stomach and colon. The DOTA linkage was installed at a mechanism-based strategic location in the pantoprazole molecule to minimize a possible negative effect of the structural modification on the drug.

We show that the expression of PIM-1 is induced in response to estradiol in MCF-7 cells and that the induction is mediated by ER\u03b1-regulated enhancers located distally upstream from the gene. In keeping with the growth-promoting role of the PIM-1, depletion of the PIM-1 attenuated the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells, which was paralleled with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor CDKN1A and CDKN2B expression. Analysis of PIM-1 expression between invasive breast tumors and benign breast tissue samples showed that elevated PIM-1 expression is associated with malignancy and a higher tumor grade. In sum, identification of PIM-1 as an ER\u03b1 target gene adds a novel potential mechanism by which estrogens can contribute to breast cancer cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

DICO was a novel nonaromatic B-ring flavonoid obtained from Macrothelypteris torresiana. In the present work, we investigated the antitumor activity and the antineoplastic mechanism of DICO. Our study showed that DICO inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1, p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have therapeutic potential against tumors.",

Due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas. Here, we report that the antifibrotic drug 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone (pirfenidone, PFD) elicits growth-inhibitory effects and reduces TGF-beta2 protein levels in human glioma cell lines. This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis.

Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.",

Because progesterone (1) affects both menstruation and gestation via the progesterone receptor (PR), research aimed at modulating its activity is usually surrounded by controversy. However, ligands for PR were developed into drugs, and their evolution can be crudely divided into three periods: (1) drug-like steroids that mimic the gestational properties of progesterone; (2) drug-like steroids with different properties from progesterone and expanded therapeutic applications; and (3) non-steroidal PR ligands with improved selectivity and modulator properties and further expanded therapeutic applications. Although the latter have yet to see widespread clinical applications, their development is founded on a half century of research, and they represent the future for this drug target.",

Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate.

Serotonin and n-acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine doc , did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland , whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine doc in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent ; furthermore , melatonin did not augment the ketamine doc whereas dopamine continued to do so. this study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood-brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat. in addition , these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine doc induced by melatonin . furthermore , dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine catatonia",

Drug-related adverse effects are mild, dose-related and reversible, characterising leflunomide as a safe immunosuppressant. While up to now leflunomide has just been approved for therapy of rheumatoid arthritis, its mechanism of action affects multiple inflammatory pathways, thereby suggesting it to be a potent therapeutic agent in autoimmune diseases, graft rejection, and tumour therapy.

For vertebrate development, vitamin A (all-trans retinol) is required in quantitative different amounts and spatiotemporal distribution for the production of retinoic acid, a nuclear hormone receptor ligand, and 11-cis retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments. We show here for zebrafish that embryonic retinoid homeostasis essentially depends on the activity of a leci-thin:retinol acyltransferase (Lratb). During embryogenesis, lratb is expressed in mostly non-overlapping domains opposite to retinal dehydrogenase 2 (raldh2), the key enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis. Blocking retinyl ester formation by a targeted knock down of Lratb results in significantly increased retinoic acid levels, which lead to severe embryonic patterning defects. Thus, we provide evidence that a balanced competition between Lratb and Raldh2 for yolk vitamin A defines embryonic compartments either for retinyl ester or retinoic acid synthesis. This homeostatic mechanism dynamically adjusts embryonic retinoic acid levels for gene regulation, concomitantly sequestering excess yolk vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters for the establishment of larval vision later during development.",

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs.

After placebo administration CRH induced a marked ACTH increase. After loperamide administration ACTH levels fell to a nadir of 135 +/- 76 pg/ml, and then CRH was still able to induce an ACTH increase; the pattern of ACTH response to CRH was slightly delayed. There was a significant difference between the two ACTH curves after CRH only in the early phase of the response.

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

Human placental 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5----4-ene isomerase (3 beta-HSD) purified from human placenta transforms C-21 (pregnenolone and 17 alpha-hydroxy pregnenolone) as well as C-19 (dehydroepiandrosterone and androst-5-ene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol) steroids into the corresponding 3-keto-4-ene-steroids and is thus involved in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. Trilostane, epostane and cyanoketone are potent inhibitors of 3 beta-HSD with Ki values of approximately 50 nM. 4-MA, a well known 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, is also a potent inhibitor of 3 beta-HSD with a Ki value of 56 nM. Synthetic progestin compounds such as promegestone and RU2323 show relatively strong inhibitory effects with Ki values of 110 and 190 nM, respectively. Cyproterone acetate, a progestin used in the treatment of hirsutism, acne and prostate cancer as well as norgestrel and norethindrone that are widely used as oral contraceptives also inhibit 3 beta-HSD activity at Ki values of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 microM, respectively.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Increased incidence of prostate cancer has been reported in men exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that influences its transcriptional activity. We investigated the influence of TCDD on prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-tumor prostate cells (PNT1A) on 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone-activated ARs containing CAG repeats within normal length range (16, 22, and 28). The AhR target gene CYP1A1 mRNA expression was induced by TCDD, but was not affected by the AR CAG length. TCDD had no effect on AR activity in PC-3 cells, whereas the shortest AR variant was induced by TCDD in PNT1A cells. In conclusion, the CAG length dependent effect of TCDD on AR activity in PNT1A, but not in PC-3 cells, indicates as a cell-specific effect of TCDD on AR activity.",

Our study showed that DICO inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1, p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have therapeutic potential against tumors.",

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis.

Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

     "context": "streptozotocin -induced diabetic nephropathy . objective : diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure , which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ros). nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. here , we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy . research design and methods : we explore the protective role of nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients , a streptozotocin -induced diabetic nephropathy model in nrf2(-/-) mice , and cultured human mesangial cells. results : the glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated nrf2 levels. in the animal study , nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin -induced renal damage . this is evident by nrf2(-/-) mice having higher ros production and suffering from greater oxidative dna damage and renal injury compared with nrf2(+/+) mice. mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the nrf2-mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is , at least , partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 ( tgf-beta1 ) and reduction of extracellular matrix production. in human renal mesangial cells , high glucose induced ros production and activated expression of nrf2 and its downstream genes. furthermore , activation or overexpression of nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of tgf-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner , whereas knockdown of nrf2 by sirna enhanced tgf-beta1 transcription and fibronectin production. conclusions : this work clearly indicates a protective role of nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy , suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy",

In order to define the biochemical mechanism involved in the hepatoprotection afforded by Sch B pretreatment, we examined the activity of DT-diaphorase (DTD) in hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated rats. Hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated (a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days) rats showed a significant increase (25%) in DTD activity. The increase in DTD activity was associated with the enhanced rate of menadione elimination in the hepatocyte culture. The ensemble of results suggests that the ability of Sch B pretreatment to enhance hepatocellular DTD activity may at least in part be attributed to the protection against menadione hepatotoxicity.",

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis.

Increased incidence of prostate cancer has been reported in men exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that influences its transcriptional activity. We investigated the influence of TCDD on prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-tumor prostate cells (PNT1A) on 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone-activated ARs containing CAG repeats within normal length range (16, 22, and 28). The AhR target gene CYP1A1 mRNA expression was induced by TCDD, but was not affected by the AR CAG length. TCDD had no effect on AR activity in PC-3 cells, whereas the shortest AR variant was induced by TCDD in PNT1A cells. In conclusion, the CAG length dependent effect of TCDD on AR activity in PNT1A, but not in PC-3 cells, indicates as a cell-specific effect of TCDD on AR activity.",

Oxybutynin (1) is a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist that is used clinically for the treatment of urinary incontinence. The major metabolite of oxybutynin in humans is desethyloxybutynin (2). We have prepared the enantiomers of 1 and 2 and evaluated their ability to displace N-CT(3)-scopolamine chloride ((3)H-NMS) binding on human cloned muscarinic m1-5 receptors. Compounds 1 and 2 potently displaced (3)H-NMS binding at m1, m3 and m4 receptors, but were less potent at the m2 and m5 subtypes. However, metabolite 2 was more potent than the parent compound 1 in the binding assay. In general the R enantiomers were more potent than their respective S enantiomers. Therefore, we suggest that the cholinergic side effects associated with 2 may be due to its greater apparent potency with m1 and m3 receptors, especially of its R-enantiomer, when compared with parent drug 1.",

Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the \u03b1(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.",

Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) induced Fos expression in the central, dorsal-medial and ventral-medial part of the striatum. The distribution pattern of Fos induced by amantadine was more similar to those seen with dopaminomimetics than with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Pretreatment with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, and the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, blocked amantadine induction of Fos in the striatum. However, amantadine induction of Fos in the striatum was unaffected by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride. These results suggest that amantadine induction of Fos in the rat striatum is related to dopamine D1 and NMDA receptors.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Notch signaling has been demonstrated to have a central role in cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We have recently demonstrated the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide (ATO) on CSLCs in glioblastoma cell lines. In this study we used neurosphere recovery assay that measured neurosphere formation at three time points to assess the capacity of the culture to repopulate after ATO treatment. Our results provided strong evidence that ATO depleted CSLCs in GBM, and inhibited neurosphere recovery and secondary neurosphere formation. ATO inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of AKT and STAT3 through Notch signaling blockade. These data show that the ATO is a promising new approach to decrease glioblastoma proliferation and recurrence by downregulation of Notch pathway.",

An HTS campaign identified several weak M5 PAMs (M5 EC50 >10\u03bcM) with a structurally related isatin core that possessed a southern phenethyl ether linkage. While SAR within the HTS series was very shallow and unable to be optimized, grafting the phenethyl ether linkage onto the ML129/ML172 cores led to the first sub-micromolar M5 PAM, ML326 (VU0467903), (human and rat M5 EC50s of 409nM and 500nM, respectively) with excellent mAChR selectivity (M1-M4 EC50s >30\u03bcM) and a robust 20-fold leftward shift of the ACh CRC.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

An HTS campaign identified several weak M5 PAMs (M5 EC50 >10\u03bcM) with a structurally related isatin core that possessed a southern phenethyl ether linkage. While SAR within the HTS series was very shallow and unable to be optimized, grafting the phenethyl ether linkage onto the ML129/ML172 cores led to the first sub-micromolar M5 PAM, ML326 (VU0467903), (human and rat M5 EC50s of 409nM and 500nM, respectively) with excellent mAChR selectivity (M1-M4 EC50s >30\u03bcM) and a robust 20-fold leftward shift of the ACh CRC.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

Phenelzine is a more potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor than is N2-acetylphenelzine. The most marked difference in the profile was that N2-acetylphenelzine had no effect on whole brain levels of the amino acid neurotransmitters alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, whereas phenelzine caused dramatic increases.

Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the \u03b1(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Pemetrexed disodium (ALIMTA) is a novel antimetabolite that inhibits at least three folate-dependent enzymes, thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. Pemetrexed disodium is broadly active in a wide variety of solid tumours, including non-small cell lung, breast, bladder, head and neck and ovarian cancers. Gemcitabine is a broadly active pyrimidine nucleoside antimetabolite, which is approved for the treatment of pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. Three preclinical studies have been reported that show cytotoxic synergy between gemcitabine and pemetrexed. Clinical activity with this combination has been observed in a phase I study, with partial responses in three of five patients previously treated for non-small cell lung cancer. An international phase II study of this combination in non-small cell lung cancer is ongoing.",

Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Detailed structure-activity relationships of the C3-phenyl moiety that allow for the optimization of antiviral potency of a series of 1,5-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]diazepine-2,4-dione inhibitors of HIV capsid (CA) assembly are described. Combination of favorable substitutions gave additive SAR and allowed for the identification of the most potent compound in the series, analog 27. Productive SAR also transferred to the benzotriazepine and spirobenzodiazepine scaffolds, providing a solution to the labile stereocenter at the C3 position. The molecular basis of how compound 27 inhibits mature CA assembly is rationalized using high-resolution structural information. Our understanding of how compound 27 may inhibit immature Gag assembly is also discussed.",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many \"sensory compounds\" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.",

To investigate the role of mGluR8 in modulating the synaptic responses of retinal ganglion cells, we used a recently identified positive allosteric modulator of mGluR8, AZ12216052 (AZ) and the mGluR8-specific orthosteric agonist (S)-3,4-dicarboxyphenylglycine (DCPG). These agents were applied to whole-cell voltage-clamped ganglion cells from an isolated, superfused mouse retina preparation. DCPG reduced OFF-ganglion cell excitatory currents, whereas AZ enhanced the peak excitatory currents in ON-, OFF-, and ON-OFF-ganglion cells. The effects on ganglion cell inhibitory currents were more varied. The effects of the allosteric modulator were stronger for bright stimuli than for dim stimuli, consistent with receptor stimulation by endogenous glutamate being stronger during bright light stimulation and with mGluR8 receptors mainly being localized away from glutamate release sites, immuno-labeled with VGLUT1. The differential sensitivity of ganglion cell light responses to DCPG and AZ supports multiple sites where mGluR8 modulates the light responses of ganglion cells.",

Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

The concentration of estramustine phosphate required to inhibit the assembly or to induce the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules is markedly dependent upon the microtubule protein concentration. Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate.

Therefore, the inhibition of this pathway may be implicated in the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

Our results show that food products contain potent HDC inhibitors and that these active food constituents might be useful for designing clinically available HDC inhibitors.",

Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the \u03b1(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.",

The carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (gamma-carboxylase) is an essential posttranslational modification required for the biological activity of a number of proteins, including proteins involved in blood coagulation and its regulation. Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the gamma-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx(+/-) intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx(-/-) offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)-deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for gamma-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.",

Due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas. Here, we report that the antifibrotic drug 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone (pirfenidone, PFD) elicits growth-inhibitory effects and reduces TGF-beta2 protein levels in human glioma cell lines. This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",

Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate.

These compounds were evaluated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity and 5-amino-2,7-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]thiophene-4,6-dicarbonitrile was found to be the most potent against AChE with IC50 4.16 \u03bcmol/L.",

The I\u03baB kinase complex (IKK) is a key regulator of immune responses, inflammation, cell survival, and tumorigenesis. The prosurvival function of IKK centers on activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, whose target gene products inhibit caspases and prevent prolonged JNK activation. Here, we report that inactivation of the BH3-only protein BAD by IKK independently of NF-\u03baB activation suppresses TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis. TNF\u03b1-treated Ikk\u03b2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) undergo apoptosis significantly faster than MEFs deficient in both RelA and cRel due to lack of inhibition of BAD by IKK. IKK phosphorylates BAD at serine-26 (Ser26) and primes it for inactivation. Elimination of Ser26 phosphorylation promotes BAD proapoptotic activity, thereby accelerating TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis in cultured cells and increasing mortality in animals. Our results reveal that IKK inhibits TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis through two distinct but cooperative mechanisms: activation of the survival factor NF-\u03baB and inactivation of the proapoptotic BH3-only BAD protein.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Cyclophosphamide ( Cyclophosphamide ) , an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite acrolein , was used to induce cystitis . materials and methods : Cyclophosphamide was administered at doses of 50 , 100 and 200 mg./kg. i.p. to male rats , and their behavior observed and scored. the effects of morphine ( 0.5 to 4 mg./kg. i.v. ) on Cyclophosphamide -induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after naloxone ( 1 mg./kg. s.c. ) . in addition , 90 minutes after Cyclophosphamide injection , that is , at the time of administration of morphine , the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination. finally , to show that the bladder is essential for the Cyclophosphamide -induced behavioral modifications , female rats also received Cyclophosphamide at doses of 200 mg./kg. i.p. and of 20 mg. by the intravesical route , and acrolein at doses of 0.5 mg. by the intravesical route and of 5 mg./kg. i.v. results : Cyclophosphamide dose-relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats : breathing rate decrease , closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures. morphine dose-dependently reversed these behavioral disorders . a dose of 0.5 mg./kg. produced a reduction of almost 50 % of the behavioral score induced by Cyclophosphamide 200 mg./kg. this effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with naloxone . at the time of administration of morphine , histological modifications of the bladder wall , such as chorionic and muscle layer edema , were observed. in female rats , Cyclophosphamide 200 mg./kg. i.p. produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats. administered at the dose of 20 mg. intravesically , Cyclophosphamide did not produce any behavioral effects , whereas acrolein at 0.5 mg. intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under Cyclophosphamide 200 mg./kg. i.p. , with the same maximal levels. conversely , acrolein 5 mg./kg. i.v. did not produce any behavioral effects at all. conclusions : overall , these results indicate that this experimental model of Cyclophosphamide -induced cystitis",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many \"sensory compounds\" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.",

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

Our study showed that DICO inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. As well as DICO induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via a ROS-mediated mitochondrial pathway. Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1, p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment. Taken together, DICO displayed a significant antitumor effect through G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which suggested DICO might have therapeutic potential against tumors.",

We have prepared the enantiomers of 1 and 2 and evaluated their ability to displace N-CT(3)-scopolamine chloride ((3)H-NMS) binding on human cloned muscarinic m1-5 receptors. Compounds 1 and 2 potently displaced (3)H-NMS binding at m1, m3 and m4 receptors, but were less potent at the m2 and m5 subtypes. However, metabolite 2 was more potent than the parent compound 1 in the binding assay. In general the R enantiomers were more potent than their respective S enantiomers.

The carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (gamma-carboxylase) is an essential posttranslational modification required for the biological activity of a number of proteins, including proteins involved in blood coagulation and its regulation. Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the gamma-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx(+/-) intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx(-/-) offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)-deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for gamma-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.",

We investigated the effects of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-FU plus uracil (UFT) with or without leucovorin on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat colorectal carcinomas. Thirty-week administration of UFT with or without leucovorin markedly suppressed both colorectal carcinogenesis and tumor growth, resulted in the increase of thymidylate synthase inhibition and the decrease of thymidine kinase activity in the tumor cells.

In this study we used neurosphere recovery assay that measured neurosphere formation at three time points to assess the capacity of the culture to repopulate after ATO treatment. Our results provided strong evidence that ATO depleted CSLCs in GBM, and inhibited neurosphere recovery and secondary neurosphere formation. ATO inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of AKT and STAT3 through Notch signaling blockade.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

Therefore, the inhibition of this pathway may be implicated in the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.",

Due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas.

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",

Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Increased incidence of prostate cancer has been reported in men exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that influences its transcriptional activity. We investigated the influence of TCDD on prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-tumor prostate cells (PNT1A) on 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone-activated ARs containing CAG repeats within normal length range (16, 22, and 28). The AhR target gene CYP1A1 mRNA expression was induced by TCDD, but was not affected by the AR CAG length. TCDD had no effect on AR activity in PC-3 cells, whereas the shortest AR variant was induced by TCDD in PNT1A cells. In conclusion, the CAG length dependent effect of TCDD on AR activity in PNT1A, but not in PC-3 cells, indicates as a cell-specific effect of TCDD on AR activity.",

Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

We searched ER\u03b1 cistromes of MCF-7 breast cancer cells for previously unrecognized ER\u03b1 targets and identified proto-oncogene PIM-1 as a novel potential target gene. We show that the expression of PIM-1 is induced in response to estradiol in MCF-7 cells and that the induction is mediated by ER\u03b1-regulated enhancers located distally upstream from the gene. In keeping with the growth-promoting role of the PIM-1, depletion of the PIM-1 attenuated the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells, which was paralleled with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor CDKN1A and CDKN2B expression. Analysis of PIM-1 expression between invasive breast tumors and benign breast tissue samples showed that elevated PIM-1 expression is associated with malignancy and a higher tumor grade. In sum, identification of PIM-1 as an ER\u03b1 target gene adds a novel potential mechanism by which estrogens can contribute to breast cancer cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.",

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a bioactive component extracted from honeybee hive propolis. Our observations indicated that CAPE treatment suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation of TW2.6 human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells dose-dependently. CAPE treatment decreased G1 phase cell population, increased G2/M phase cell population, and induced apoptosis in TW2.6 cells. Treatment with CAPE decreased protein abundance of Akt, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, phospho-Akt Ser473, phospho-Akt Thr 308, GSK3\u03b2, FOXO1, FOXO3a, phospho-FOXO1 Thr24, phospho-FoxO3a Thr32, NF-\u03baB, phospho-NF-\u03baB Ser536, Rb, phospho-Rb Ser807/811, Skp2, and cyclin D1, but increased cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Overexpression of Akt1 or Akt2 in TW2.6 cells rescued growth inhibition caused by CAPE treatment. Co-treating TW2.6 cells with CAPE and 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for oral cancers, exhibited additive cell proliferation inhibition. Our study suggested that administration of CAPE is a potential adjuvant therapy for patients with OSCC oral cancer.",

The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the \u03b1(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.",

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

     "context": "Secretion of L-glutamate from osteoclasts through transcytosis. Osteoclasts are involved in the catabolism of the bone matrix and eliminate the resulting degradation products through transcytosis, but the molecular mechanism and regulation of transcytosis remain poorly understood. Upon differentiation, osteoclasts express vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is essential for vesicular storage and subsequent exocytosis of glutamate in neurons. VGLUT1 is localized in transcytotic vesicles and accumulates L-glutamate. Osteoclasts secrete L-glutamate and the bone degradation products upon stimulation with KCl or ATP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. KCl- and ATP-dependent secretion of L-glutamate was absent in osteoclasts prepared from VGLUT1-/- knockout mice. Osteoclasts express mGluR8, a class III metabotropic glutamate receptor. Its stimulation by a specific agonist inhibits secretion of L-glutamate and bone degradation products, whereas its suppression by a specific antagonist stimulates bone resorption. Finally, it was found that VGLUT1-/- mice develop osteoporosis. Thus, in bone-resorbing osteoclasts, L-glutamate and bone degradation products are secreted through transcytosis and the released L-glutamate is involved in autoregulation of transcytosis. Glutamate signaling may play an important role in the bone homeostasis.",

Human placental 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/5----4-ene isomerase (3 beta-HSD) purified from human placenta transforms C-21 (pregnenolone and 17 alpha-hydroxy pregnenolone) as well as C-19 (dehydroepiandrosterone and androst-5-ene-3 beta, 17 beta-diol) steroids into the corresponding 3-keto-4-ene-steroids and is thus involved in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. Trilostane, epostane and cyanoketone are potent inhibitors of 3 beta-HSD with Ki values of approximately 50 nM. 4-MA, a well known 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, is also a potent inhibitor of 3 beta-HSD with a Ki value of 56 nM. Synthetic progestin compounds such as promegestone and RU2323 show relatively strong inhibitory effects with Ki values of 110 and 190 nM, respectively. Cyproterone acetate, a progestin used in the treatment of hirsutism, acne and prostate cancer as well as norgestrel and norethindrone that are widely used as oral contraceptives also inhibit 3 beta-HSD activity at Ki values of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 microM, respectively.",

Therefore, the inhibition of this pathway may be implicated in the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.",

Therefore, the inhibition of this pathway may be implicated in the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

The I\u03baB kinase complex (IKK) is a key regulator of immune responses, inflammation, cell survival, and tumorigenesis. The prosurvival function of IKK centers on activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, whose target gene products inhibit caspases and prevent prolonged JNK activation. Here, we report that inactivation of the BH3-only protein BAD by IKK independently of NF-\u03baB activation suppresses TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis. TNF\u03b1-treated Ikk\u03b2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) undergo apoptosis significantly faster than MEFs deficient in both RelA and cRel due to lack of inhibition of BAD by IKK. IKK phosphorylates BAD at serine-26 (Ser26) and primes it for inactivation. Elimination of Ser26 phosphorylation promotes BAD proapoptotic activity, thereby accelerating TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis in cultured cells and increasing mortality in animals. Our results reveal that IKK inhibits TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis through two distinct but cooperative mechanisms: activation of the survival factor NF-\u03baB and inactivation of the proapoptotic BH3-only BAD protein.",

The initial leads in this series, compounds 1a and 1h, showed promising potencies, but a lack of selectivity against other isoforms in the JAK family. Computational and crystallographic analysis suggested that the phenyl ether moiety possessed a favorable vector to achieve selectivity. Exploration of this vector resulted in the identification of 12b and 12d, as potent JAK3 inhibitors, demonstrating improved JAK family and kinase selectivity.",

The carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (gamma-carboxylase) is an essential posttranslational modification required for the biological activity of a number of proteins, including proteins involved in blood coagulation and its regulation. Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the gamma-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx(+/-) intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx(-/-) offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)-deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for gamma-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.",

We asked whether this disordered loop might order during the course of catalysis and provide a means for an enzyme that requires a large substrate access channel to restrict access to the catalytic machinery by smaller compounds that might potentially enter the active site and be metabolized. Our experiments, a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and crystallographic techniques, suggest that a disorder to order transition is linked to catalytic activity.",

To overcome this limitation, we de novo synthesized a conjugate that covalently combines a Gd-based MRI contrast agent, encaged with a chelating agent (DOTA), with pantoprazole, which is a widely used proton pump inhibitor that binds to proton pumps in the stomach and colon. The DOTA linkage was installed at a mechanism-based strategic location in the pantoprazole molecule to minimize a possible negative effect of the structural modification on the drug.

Retinoid is a collective term for compounds which bind to and activate retinoic acid receptors (RARalpha, beta, gamma and RXRalpha, beta, gamma), members of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The most important endogeneous retinoid is all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) which is an RARalpha, beta and gamma ligand. ATRA and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and some skin diseases. Many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. Among them, tamibarotene (Am80) is an RARalpha- and RARbeta-specific (but RARgamma- and RXRs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is effective in the treatment of psoriasis patients and relapsed APL. Experimentally, this compound is also active in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On this background, possible application of retinoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases was discussed. In particular, Th1 dominant autoimmune diseases may be the targets of the retinoids.",

Therefore, the inhibition of this pathway may be implicated in the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.",

However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a bioactive component extracted from honeybee hive propolis.

CAPE treatment decreased G1 phase cell population, increased G2/M phase cell population, and induced apoptosis in TW2.6 cells. Treatment with CAPE decreased protein abundance of Akt, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, phospho-Akt Ser473, phospho-Akt Thr 308, GSK3\u03b2, FOXO1, FOXO3a, phospho-FOXO1 Thr24, phospho-FoxO3a Thr32, NF-\u03baB, phospho-NF-\u03baB Ser536, Rb, phospho-Rb Ser807/811, Skp2, and cyclin D1, but increased cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Overexpression of Akt1 or Akt2 in TW2.6 cells rescued growth inhibition caused by CAPE treatment. Co-treating TW2.6 cells with CAPE and 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for oral cancers, exhibited additive cell proliferation inhibition.

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Therefore, the inhibition of this pathway may be implicated in the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.",

For vertebrate development, vitamin A (all-trans retinol) is required in quantitative different amounts and spatiotemporal distribution for the production of retinoic acid, a nuclear hormone receptor ligand, and 11-cis retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments. We show here for zebrafish that embryonic retinoid homeostasis essentially depends on the activity of a leci-thin:retinol acyltransferase (Lratb). During embryogenesis, lratb is expressed in mostly non-overlapping domains opposite to retinal dehydrogenase 2 (raldh2), the key enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis. Blocking retinyl ester formation by a targeted knock down of Lratb results in significantly increased retinoic acid levels, which lead to severe embryonic patterning defects. Thus, we provide evidence that a balanced competition between Lratb and Raldh2 for yolk vitamin A defines embryonic compartments either for retinyl ester or retinoic acid synthesis. This homeostatic mechanism dynamically adjusts embryonic retinoic acid levels for gene regulation, concomitantly sequestering excess yolk vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters for the establishment of larval vision later during development.",

With regard to structure-activity relationship (SAR) trends among the various substituents on the pyridyl ring, relatively small and nonbasic substituents were preferable to sterically demanding or basic substituents. Oxazolidinone ring substitution on the pyridyl ring generated analogues with antibacterial activity superior to imidazolidinone ring. Solubility was enhanced by the incorporation of polar groups, especially when compounds were converted to their prodrugs. Among the prodrugs, compound 85 exhibited excellent solubility and a good pharmacokinetic profile.

Proline oxidase (POX), a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, catalyzes the rate-limiting oxidation of proline to pyrroline- 5-carboxylate (P5C). Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

CAPE treatment decreased G1 phase cell population, increased G2/M phase cell population, and induced apoptosis in TW2.6 cells.

Overexpression of Akt1 or Akt2 in TW2.6 cells rescued growth inhibition caused by CAPE treatment. Co-treating TW2.6 cells with CAPE and 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for oral cancers, exhibited additive cell proliferation inhibition.

Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs.

The concentration of estramustine phosphate required to inhibit the assembly or to induce the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules is markedly dependent upon the microtubule protein concentration. Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate. It is proposed that two molecules of estramustine phosphate interact with each of the three tubulin-binding sites of MAP2 and inhibit the MAP2:tubulin interaction by neutralising two highly conserved basic residues.",

While SAR within the HTS series was very shallow and unable to be optimized, grafting the phenethyl ether linkage onto the ML129/ML172 cores led to the first sub-micromolar M5 PAM, ML326 (VU0467903), (human and rat M5 EC50s of 409nM and 500nM, respectively) with excellent mAChR selectivity (M1-M4 EC50s >30\u03bcM) and a robust 20-fold leftward shift of the ACh CRC.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

Due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas. Here, we report that the antifibrotic drug 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone (pirfenidone, PFD) elicits growth-inhibitory effects and reduces TGF-beta2 protein levels in human glioma cell lines. This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",

We previously reported that caffeoyl-amino acidyl-hydroxamic acid (CA-Xaa-NHOH) acted as both a good antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibitor, in particular when caffeic acid was conjugated with proline or amino acids having aromatic ring like phenylalanine. Here, various hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) derivatives were further conjugated with phenylalanyl hydroxamic acid and prolyl hydroxamic acid (HCA-Phe-NHOH and HCA-Pro-NHOH) to study the structure and activity relationship as both antioxidants and tyrosinase inhibitors. When their biological activities were evaluated, all HCA-Phe-NHOH and HCA-Pro-NHOH exhibited enhanced antioxidant activity compared to HCA alone. Moreover, derivatives of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid inhibited lipid peroxidation more efficiently than vitamin E analogue (Trolox). In addition, derivatives of caffeic acid and sinapic acid efficiently inhibited tyrosinase activity and reduced melanin content in melanocytes Mel-Ab cell.",

Several temperature-activated transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) ion channels are the molecular receptors of natural compounds that evoke thermal and pain sensations. Menthol, popularly known for its cooling effect, activates TRPM8--a cold-activated thermoTRP ion channel. However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs. Therefore, we find that many \"sensory compounds\" presumed to be specific have a promiscuous relationship with thermoTRPs.",

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",

CAPE treatment decreased G1 phase cell population, increased G2/M phase cell population, and induced apoptosis in TW2.6 cells. Treatment with CAPE decreased protein abundance of Akt, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, phospho-Akt Ser473, phospho-Akt Thr 308, GSK3\u03b2, FOXO1, FOXO3a, phospho-FOXO1 Thr24, phospho-FoxO3a Thr32, NF-\u03baB, phospho-NF-\u03baB Ser536, Rb, phospho-Rb Ser807/811, Skp2, and cyclin D1, but increased cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip.

We investigated the effects of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-FU plus uracil (UFT) with or without leucovorin on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat colorectal carcinomas. Thirty-week administration of UFT with or without leucovorin markedly suppressed both colorectal carcinogenesis and tumor growth, resulted in the increase of thymidylate synthase inhibition and the decrease of thymidine kinase activity in the tumor cells.

In contrast, tyrosine hydroxylase knockout (Th -/-) mice that lack both NE and dopamine (DA) have reduced levels of NET, suggesting that it is down-regulated by a complete absence of catecholamines and not NE per se. Chronic treatment with the NET inhibitor, desipramine (DMI), reduced NET levels in both control and Dbh -/- mice, demonstrating that NE is not required for the regulation of NET by antidepressant drugs. There are some qualitative and quantitative differences in the down-regulation of the NET by catecholamine depletion and DMI treatment, suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved.",

Studies with dexfenfluramine, an anorectic agent which releases 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from nerve terminals and inhibits its reuptake, have considerably increased our knowledge of the role of 5-HT in feeding control. 5-HT1B receptors mediate the satiating effect of dexfenfluramine, whereas the mechanism by which 5-HT uptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine and sertraline cause anorexia is not clear. Anorexia induced by (+)-amphetamine, phentermine, diethylpropion and phenylpropanolamine seems to be the result of their ability to increase the release of noradrenaline and/or dopamine from nerve terminals and inhibit their reuptake or, in the case of phenylpropanolamine, to stimulate directly alpha 1-adrenoceptors. It has been suggested that beta- and alpha 1-adrenoceptors and D1 dopamine receptors are involved in their effect on food intake. The difficulties of extrapolation across species limit our knowledge of the mechanism of the anorectic action in humans. Significant advances in the treatment of feeding pathology will be linked to identifying new receptor types and subtypes for neurotransmitters and quantifying and modelling eating disorders such as binge-eating and food craving.",

To investigate the role of mGluR8 in modulating the synaptic responses of retinal ganglion cells, we used a recently identified positive allosteric modulator of mGluR8, AZ12216052 (AZ) and the mGluR8-specific orthosteric agonist (S)-3,4-dicarboxyphenylglycine (DCPG). These agents were applied to whole-cell voltage-clamped ganglion cells from an isolated, superfused mouse retina preparation. DCPG reduced OFF-ganglion cell excitatory currents, whereas AZ enhanced the peak excitatory currents in ON-, OFF-, and ON-OFF-ganglion cells. The effects on ganglion cell inhibitory currents were more varied. The effects of the allosteric modulator were stronger for bright stimuli than for dim stimuli, consistent with receptor stimulation by endogenous glutamate being stronger during bright light stimulation and with mGluR8 receptors mainly being localized away from glutamate release sites, immuno-labeled with VGLUT1. The differential sensitivity of ganglion cell light responses to DCPG and AZ supports multiple sites where mGluR8 modulates the light responses of ganglion cells.",

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

In contrast, tyrosine hydroxylase knockout (Th -/-) mice that lack both NE and dopamine (DA) have reduced levels of NET, suggesting that it is down-regulated by a complete absence of catecholamines and not NE per se. Chronic treatment with the NET inhibitor, desipramine (DMI), reduced NET levels in both control and Dbh -/- mice, demonstrating that NE is not required for the regulation of NET by antidepressant drugs.

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a bioactive component extracted from honeybee hive propolis. Our observations indicated that CAPE treatment suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation of TW2.6 human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells dose-dependently. CAPE treatment decreased G1 phase cell population, increased G2/M phase cell population, and induced apoptosis in TW2.6 cells. Treatment with CAPE decreased protein abundance of Akt, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, phospho-Akt Ser473, phospho-Akt Thr 308, GSK3\u03b2, FOXO1, FOXO3a, phospho-FOXO1 Thr24, phospho-FoxO3a Thr32, NF-\u03baB, phospho-NF-\u03baB Ser536, Rb, phospho-Rb Ser807/811, Skp2, and cyclin D1, but increased cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Overexpression of Akt1 or Akt2 in TW2.6 cells rescued growth inhibition caused by CAPE treatment. Co-treating TW2.6 cells with CAPE and 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for oral cancers, exhibited additive cell proliferation inhibition. Our study suggested that administration of CAPE is a potential adjuvant therapy for patients with OSCC oral cancer.",

ATRA and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and some skin diseases. Many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. Among them, tamibarotene (Am80) is an RARalpha- and RARbeta-specific (but RARgamma- and RXRs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is effective in the treatment of psoriasis patients and relapsed APL. Experimentally, this compound is also active in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On this background, possible application of retinoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases was discussed. In particular, Th1 dominant autoimmune diseases may be the targets of the retinoids.",

Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

After placebo administration CRH induced a marked ACTH increase. After loperamide administration ACTH levels fell to a nadir of 135 +/- 76 pg/ml, and then CRH was still able to induce an ACTH increase; the pattern of ACTH response to CRH was slightly delayed. There was a significant difference between the two ACTH curves after CRH only in the early phase of the response.

To overcome this limitation, we de novo synthesized a conjugate that covalently combines a Gd-based MRI contrast agent, encaged with a chelating agent (DOTA), with pantoprazole, which is a widely used proton pump inhibitor that binds to proton pumps in the stomach and colon. The DOTA linkage was installed at a mechanism-based strategic location in the pantoprazole molecule to minimize a possible negative effect of the structural modification on the drug. It is anticipated that by defining the wall of the stomach and colon, this compound will facilitate functional MRI of the GI tract in humans.",

The interaction of holo- and apo-forms of human alpha-lactalbumin with fatty acids was studied by a partition equilibrium method. Apo-alpha-lactalbumin, obtained by treatment with EDTA, displays one binding site for fatty acids, the association constants for oleic and palmitic acids being 1.9.10(6) and 4.2.10(5) M(-1), respectively. However, holo-alpha-lactalbumin was unable to bind fatty acids as measured by this technique. Likewise, no fatty acids bound to holo-alpha-lactalbumin, isolated using nondenaturing conditions, were detected by gas chromatography. These results demonstrate that the conformational change induced in alpha-lactalbumin by the removal of calcium enables the protein to interact with fatty acids.",

We investigated the effects of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-FU plus uracil (UFT) with or without leucovorin on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat colorectal carcinomas. Thirty-week administration of UFT with or without leucovorin markedly suppressed both colorectal carcinogenesis and tumor growth, resulted in the increase of thymidylate synthase inhibition and the decrease of thymidine kinase activity in the tumor cells.

Phenelzine is a more potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor than is N2-acetylphenelzine. The most marked difference in the profile was that N2-acetylphenelzine had no effect on whole brain levels of the amino acid neurotransmitters alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, whereas phenelzine caused dramatic increases.

Elevated levels of triglyceride (TG), along with hepatic TG content and glucose concentrations in a high fat diet group were found to be reduced by fisetin supplementation. The high fat diet significantly increased hepatic mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3, SREBP1C and SCD-1 genes in comparison to the control diet, which was subsequently reversed by supplementation with fisetin. In addition, fisetin supplementation significantly reduced hepatic mRNA abundance of FAS, ATPCL and G6Pase compared to the control group. Finally, epididymal mRNA abundance of GLUT4 was significantly increased by fisetin supplementation, compared to levels in the control and HF groups. Enhancement of GLUT4 expression by fisetin was further confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Fisetin supplementation decreases cardiovascular risks by ameliorating hepatic steatosis and lowering circulating glucose concentrations.",

Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

Western blot assay demonstrated that DICO decreased Bcl-2 level and induced Bax translocation to cause cytochrome c release. Subsequently, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated. Meanwhile, the alterations of cyclin A and B1, p-CDK1 and p-cdc25c levels were also observed in response to DICO treatment.

The neurochemical properties of N2-acetylphenelzine were compared with those of phenelzine in a rat model. N2-Acetylphenelzine is a relatively potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-A and -B and causes increases in whole-brain levels of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, and decreases in homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acetic after acute i.p. administration of the drug. Phenelzine is a more potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor than is N2-acetylphenelzine. The most marked difference in the profile was that N2-acetylphenelzine had no effect on whole brain levels of the amino acid neurotransmitters alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, whereas phenelzine caused dramatic increases. Acetylation of phenelzine at the N2 position presumably interferes with the inhibition of the transaminase enzymes for gamma-aminobutyric acid and alanine.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

However, human physiological studies demonstrate a paradoxical role of menthol in modulation of warm sensation, and here, we show that menthol also activates heat-activated TRPV3. We further show that menthol inhibits TRPA1, potentially explaining the use of menthol as an analgesic. Similar to menthol, both camphor and cinnamaldehyde (initially reported to be specific activators of TRPV3 and TRPA1, respectively) also modulate other thermoTRPs.

For vertebrate development, vitamin A (all-trans retinol) is required in quantitative different amounts and spatiotemporal distribution for the production of retinoic acid, a nuclear hormone receptor ligand, and 11-cis retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments. We show here for zebrafish that embryonic retinoid homeostasis essentially depends on the activity of a leci-thin:retinol acyltransferase (Lratb). During embryogenesis, lratb is expressed in mostly non-overlapping domains opposite to retinal dehydrogenase 2 (raldh2), the key enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis. Blocking retinyl ester formation by a targeted knock down of Lratb results in significantly increased retinoic acid levels, which lead to severe embryonic patterning defects. Thus, we provide evidence that a balanced competition between Lratb and Raldh2 for yolk vitamin A defines embryonic compartments either for retinyl ester or retinoic acid synthesis. This homeostatic mechanism dynamically adjusts embryonic retinoic acid levels for gene regulation, concomitantly sequestering excess yolk vitamin A in the form of retinyl esters for the establishment of larval vision later during development.",

While SAR within the HTS series was very shallow and unable to be optimized, grafting the phenethyl ether linkage onto the ML129/ML172 cores led to the first sub-micromolar M5 PAM, ML326 (VU0467903), (human and rat M5 EC50s of 409nM and 500nM, respectively) with excellent mAChR selectivity (M1-M4 EC50s >30\u03bcM) and a robust 20-fold leftward shift of the ACh CRC.",

Therefore, the inhibition of this pathway may be implicated in the degeneration of neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurological disorders. Here we study the participation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway on apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT inhibition in cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). LY294002, a specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor, selectively activated the p38 MAPK kinase pathway and enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation, but did not activate JNK. The pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) protected primary cultures of rat CGCs from LY294002-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, both compounds decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and lowered mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene dp5, a direct target of c-Jun. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PI3K/AKT inhibition induces neuronal apoptosis, a process that is mediated by the activation of p38 MAPK/c-Jun/dp5.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

We found that activation of the latent Pik3ca(H1047R) allele resulted in breast tumors with multiple histological types. Whole-exome analysis of the Pik3ca(H1047R)-driven mammary tumors identified multiple mutations, including Trp53 mutations that appeared spontaneously during the development of adenocarinoma and spindle cell tumors.

In this study we used neurosphere recovery assay that measured neurosphere formation at three time points to assess the capacity of the culture to repopulate after ATO treatment. Our results provided strong evidence that ATO depleted CSLCs in GBM, and inhibited neurosphere recovery and secondary neurosphere formation.

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

The carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (gamma-carboxylase) is an essential posttranslational modification required for the biological activity of a number of proteins, including proteins involved in blood coagulation and its regulation. Heterozygous mice carrying a null mutation at the gamma-carboxylase (Ggcx) gene exhibit normal development and survival with no evidence of hemorrhage and normal functional activity of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors IX, X, and prothrombin. Analysis of a Ggcx(+/-) intercross revealed a partial developmental block with only 50% of expected Ggcx(-/-) offspring surviving to term, with the latter animals dying uniformly at birth of massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage. This phenotype closely resembles the partial midembryonic loss and postnatal hemorrhage previously reported for both prothrombin- and factor V (F5)-deficient mice. These data exclude the existence of a redundant carboxylase pathway and suggest that functionally critical substrates for gamma-carboxylation, at least in the developing embryo and neonate, are primarily restricted to components of the blood coagulation cascade.",

Proline oxidase (POX), a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, catalyzes the rate-limiting oxidation of proline to pyrroline- 5-carboxylate (P5C). Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

ATRA and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and some skin diseases. Many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. Among them, tamibarotene (Am80) is an RARalpha- and RARbeta-specific (but RARgamma- and RXRs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is effective in the treatment of psoriasis patients and relapsed APL. Experimentally, this compound is also active in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On this background, possible application of retinoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases was discussed. In particular, Th1 dominant autoimmune diseases may be the targets of the retinoids.",

One of the most prominent features of this drug is that it provides anesthesia without gross changes in hemodynamic parameters. This feature allows using etomidate in patients with considerable cardiopulmonary compromise avoiding the characteristic hypotension produced by other anesthetics. The mechanism that provides the basis for its cardiovascular stability is the capacity to bind and stimulate peripheral alpha-2B adrenergic receptors with a subsequent vasoconstriction.

CAPE treatment decreased G1 phase cell population, increased G2/M phase cell population, and induced apoptosis in TW2.6 cells.

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Phenelzine is a more potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor than is N2-acetylphenelzine. The most marked difference in the profile was that N2-acetylphenelzine had no effect on whole brain levels of the amino acid neurotransmitters alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, whereas phenelzine caused dramatic increases. Acetylation of phenelzine at the N2 position presumably interferes with the inhibition of the transaminase enzymes for gamma-aminobutyric acid and alanine.",

CAPE treatment decreased G1 phase cell population, increased G2/M phase cell population, and induced apoptosis in TW2.6 cells.

Previously we showed that overexpression of POX is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in POX-inducible colorectal cancer cells, DLD-1.POX. We also showed expression of mitochondrial MnSOD partially blunts POX-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. To further investigate the molecular basis of POX-induced apoptosis, we utilized the DLD-1.POX cells to show that cells overproducing POX exhibit an L-proline-dependent apoptotic response. The apoptotic effect is specific for L-proline, detectable at 0.2 mM, maximal at 1 mM, and occurs during 48-72 h following the addition of L-proline to cells with maximally induced POX. The apoptotic response is mitochondria-mediated with release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-9, chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation, and cell shrinkage. We conclude that in the presence of proline, high POX activity is sufficient to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

Synthetic progestin compounds such as promegestone and RU2323 show relatively strong inhibitory effects with Ki values of 110 and 190 nM, respectively. Cyproterone acetate, a progestin used in the treatment of hirsutism, acne and prostate cancer as well as norgestrel and norethindrone that are widely used as oral contraceptives also inhibit 3 beta-HSD activity at Ki values of 1.5, 1.7 and 2.5 microM, respectively.",

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",

The I\u03baB kinase complex (IKK) is a key regulator of immune responses, inflammation, cell survival, and tumorigenesis. The prosurvival function of IKK centers on activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, whose target gene products inhibit caspases and prevent prolonged JNK activation. Here, we report that inactivation of the BH3-only protein BAD by IKK independently of NF-\u03baB activation suppresses TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis. TNF\u03b1-treated Ikk\u03b2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) undergo apoptosis significantly faster than MEFs deficient in both RelA and cRel due to lack of inhibition of BAD by IKK. IKK phosphorylates BAD at serine-26 (Ser26) and primes it for inactivation. Elimination of Ser26 phosphorylation promotes BAD proapoptotic activity, thereby accelerating TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis in cultured cells and increasing mortality in animals. Our results reveal that IKK inhibits TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis through two distinct but cooperative mechanisms: activation of the survival factor NF-\u03baB and inactivation of the proapoptotic BH3-only BAD protein.",

Our results provided strong evidence that ATO depleted CSLCs in GBM, and inhibited neurosphere recovery and secondary neurosphere formation. ATO inhibited the phosphorylation and activation of AKT and STAT3 through Notch signaling blockade. These data show that the ATO is a promising new approach to decrease glioblastoma proliferation and recurrence by downregulation of Notch pathway.",

However, holo-alpha-lactalbumin was unable to bind fatty acids as measured by this technique. Likewise, no fatty acids bound to holo-alpha-lactalbumin, isolated using nondenaturing conditions, were detected by gas chromatography. These results demonstrate that the conformational change induced in alpha-lactalbumin by the removal of calcium enables the protein to interact with fatty acids.",

Tube-building sabellariid polychaetes have major impacts on the geology and ecology of shorelines worldwide. Sandcastle worms, Phragmatopoma californica (Fewkes), live along the western coast of North America. Individual sabellariid worms build tubular shells by gluing together mineral particles with a multipart polyelectrolytic adhesive. Distinct sets of oppositely charged components are packaged and stored in concentrated granules in separate cell types. Homogeneous granules contain sulfated macromolecules as counter-polyanion to polycationic Pc2 and Pc5 proteins, which become major components of the fully cured glue. Heterogeneous granules contain polyphosphoproteins, Pc3A/B, paired with divalent cations and polycationic Pc1 and Pc4 proteins. Both types of granules contain catechol oxidase that catalyzes oxidative cross-linking of L-DOPA. Co-secretion of catechol oxidase guarantees rapid and spatially homogeneous curing with limited mixing of the preassembled adhesive packets. Catechol oxidase remains active long after the glue is fully cured, perhaps providing an active cue for conspecific larval settlement.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

The role of the cholinergic system with respect to cognitive deficits characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a number of studies focusing on the development of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors as a drug for treating this disease. The earliest known AChE inhibitors, namely, physostigmine and tacrine, performed poorly in clinical trials (e.g., poor oral activity, brain penetration, and hepatotoxic liability). Studies were then focused on finding a new type of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that would overcome the disadvantages of these two compounds. Donepezil hydrochloride inaugurates a new class of AChE inhibitors with longer and more selective action and with manageable adverse effects.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and nonprostatic solid tumor neovasculature and is a target for anticancer imaging and therapeutic agents. PSMA acts as a glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) on small molecule substrates, including folate, the anticancer drug methotrexate, and the neuropeptide N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. Here we present the 3.5-A crystal structure of the PSMA ectodomain, which reveals a homodimer with structural similarity to transferrin receptor, a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin that lacks protease activity. Unlike transferrin receptor, the protease domain of PSMA contains a binuclear zinc site, catalytic residues, and a proposed substrate-binding arginine patch. Elucidation of the PSMA structure combined with docking studies and a proposed catalytic mechanism provides insight into the recognition of inhibitors and the natural substrate N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate. The PSMA structure will facilitate development of chemotherapeutics, cancer-imaging agents, and agents for treatment of neurological disorders.",

Increased incidence of prostate cancer has been reported in men exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that influences its transcriptional activity. We investigated the influence of TCDD on prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-tumor prostate cells (PNT1A) on 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone-activated ARs containing CAG repeats within normal length range (16, 22, and 28). The AhR target gene CYP1A1 mRNA expression was induced by TCDD, but was not affected by the AR CAG length. TCDD had no effect on AR activity in PC-3 cells, whereas the shortest AR variant was induced by TCDD in PNT1A cells. In conclusion, the CAG length dependent effect of TCDD on AR activity in PNT1A, but not in PC-3 cells, indicates as a cell-specific effect of TCDD on AR activity.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

In order to define the biochemical mechanism involved in the hepatoprotection afforded by Sch B pretreatment, we examined the activity of DT-diaphorase (DTD) in hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated rats. Hepatocytes isolated from Sch B pretreated (a daily dose of 1 mmol/kg for 3 days) rats showed a significant increase (25%) in DTD activity. The increase in DTD activity was associated with the enhanced rate of menadione elimination in the hepatocyte culture. The ensemble of results suggests that the ability of Sch B pretreatment to enhance hepatocellular DTD activity may at least in part be attributed to the protection against menadione hepatotoxicity.",

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",

Osteoclasts are involved in the catabolism of the bone matrix and eliminate the resulting degradation products through transcytosis, but the molecular mechanism and regulation of transcytosis remain poorly understood. Upon differentiation, osteoclasts express vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is essential for vesicular storage and subsequent exocytosis of glutamate in neurons. VGLUT1 is localized in transcytotic vesicles and accumulates L-glutamate. Osteoclasts secrete L-glutamate and the bone degradation products upon stimulation with KCl or ATP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. KCl- and ATP-dependent secretion of L-glutamate was absent in osteoclasts prepared from VGLUT1-/- knockout mice. Osteoclasts express mGluR8, a class III metabotropic glutamate receptor. Its stimulation by a specific agonist inhibits secretion of L-glutamate and bone degradation products, whereas its suppression by a specific antagonist stimulates bone resorption. Finally, it was found that VGLUT1-/- mice develop osteoporosis. Thus, in bone-resorbing osteoclasts, L-glutamate and bone degradation products are secreted through transcytosis and the released L-glutamate is involved in autoregulation of transcytosis. Glutamate signaling may play an important role in the bone homeostasis.",

Increased incidence of prostate cancer has been reported in men exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD acts through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which interacts with the androgen receptor (AR). The AR gene contains a polymorphic CAG repeat that influences its transcriptional activity. We investigated the influence of TCDD on prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and non-tumor prostate cells (PNT1A) on 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone-activated ARs containing CAG repeats within normal length range (16, 22, and 28). The AhR target gene CYP1A1 mRNA expression was induced by TCDD, but was not affected by the AR CAG length. TCDD had no effect on AR activity in PC-3 cells, whereas the shortest AR variant was induced by TCDD in PNT1A cells. In conclusion, the CAG length dependent effect of TCDD on AR activity in PNT1A, but not in PC-3 cells, indicates as a cell-specific effect of TCDD on AR activity.",

However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis.

Thymidylate synthase and thymidine kinase are key enzymes involved in the de novo and salvage pathways for pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, respectively. Thymidylate synthase is inhibited by 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, forming an inactive ternary complex with intracellular folate. We investigated the effects of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-FU plus uracil (UFT) with or without leucovorin on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat colorectal carcinomas. Thirty-week administration of UFT with or without leucovorin markedly suppressed both colorectal carcinogenesis and tumor growth, resulted in the increase of thymidylate synthase inhibition and the decrease of thymidine kinase activity in the tumor cells. These results indicate that the combination of UFT with leucovorin could be useful in the development of pre- and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy programs.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

Cardiomyopathy is the main cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Here, we show that oral administration of resveratrol, which leads to activation of an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, suppresses cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and restores cardiac diastolic function in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The pro-hypertrophic co-activator p300 protein but not p300 mRNA was up-regulated in the mdx heart, and resveratrol administration down-regulated the p300 protein level. In cultured cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the \u03b1(1)-agonist phenylephrine was inhibited by the overexpression of SIRT1 as well as resveratrol, both of which down-regulated p300 protein levels but not p300 mRNA levels. In addition, activation of atrial natriuretic peptide promoter by p300 was inhibited by SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 induced p300 down-regulation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by deacetylation of lysine residues for ubiquitination. These findings indicate the pathological significance of p300 up-regulation in the dystrophic heart and indicate that SIRT1 activation has therapeutic potential for dystrophic cardiomyopathy.",

The most important endogeneous retinoid is all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) which is an RARalpha, beta and gamma ligand. ATRA and its mimics have been in clinical use for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and some skin diseases. Many synthetic retinoids have been developed and attempts to improve their medicinal properties have been made. Among them, tamibarotene (Am80) is an RARalpha- and RARbeta-specific (but RARgamma- and RXRs-nonbinding) synthetic retinoid that is effective in the treatment of psoriasis patients and relapsed APL. Experimentally, this compound is also active in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On this background, possible application of retinoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases was discussed. In particular, Th1 dominant autoimmune diseases may be the targets of the retinoids.",

About 99% of a dose of diflunisal is unavailable for reaction with the target enzyme, because diflunisal strongly binds to human serum albumin (HSA). To reduce the binding affinity of diflunisal to albumin, we designed and synthesized the prodrug acetyldiflunisal. The crystal structure of HSA complexed with fatty acid and acetyldiflunisal revealed that acetyldiflunisal binds to the IIA subdomain and that upon binding, it acetylates lysine 199. Mass spectrometry confirmed that acetyldiflunisal acetylates Lys199. The acetylated albumin had twofold weaker binding affinity for diflunisal as demonstrated by fluorescence quenching. Reduced binding affinity means that diflunisal is more easily released from acetylated albumin into the circulation. Therefore, lower doses of acetyldiflunisal compared to diflunisal will be required. Taken together, our results not only provide a template for design of HSA-based prodrugs, but also pave the way toward more effective use of diflunisal in the clinic.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

The concentration of estramustine phosphate required to inhibit the assembly or to induce the disassembly of chick brain MAP2:tubulin microtubules is markedly dependent upon the microtubule protein concentration. Analysis of this relationship shows that estramustine phosphate and tubulin compete for common MAP2 sites, that MAP2 can bind 5-6 moles.mole-1 estramustine phosphate, and that the Kd of these sites is congruent to 20 microM estramustine phosphate. It is proposed that two molecules of estramustine phosphate interact with each of the three tubulin-binding sites of MAP2 and inhibit the MAP2:tubulin interaction by neutralising two highly conserved basic residues.",

Methadone N-demethylation in vitro is catalyzed by hepatic cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) and CYP3A4, but clinical disposition is often attributed to CYP3A4. This investigation tested the hypothesis that CYP2B6 is a prominent CYP isoform responsible for clinical methadone N-demethylation and clearance, using the in vivo mechanism-based CYP2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine, given orally for 4 days. A preliminary clinical investigation with the CYP3A4/5 substrate probe alfentanil established that ticlopidine did not inhibit intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4/5. Subjects received intravenous plus oral (deuterium-labeled) racemic methadone before and after ticlopidine. Ticlopidine significantly and stereoselectively (S\u2009>\u2009R) inhibited methadone N-demethylation, decreasing plasma metabolite/methadone area under the curve ratios and metabolite formation clearances. Ticlopidine also significantly increased the dose-adjusted plasma area under the curve for R- and S-methadone by 20% and 60%, respectively, after both intravenous and oral dosing. CYP2B6 inhibition reduces methadone N-demethylation and clearance, and alters methadone concentrations, demonstrating an important role for CYP2B6 in clinical methadone disposition.",

Wogonin, a naturally occurring monoflavonoid extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has been reported for its anti-oxidant activity. However, it is still unclear whether wogonin can inhibit oxidant-induced vascular permeability. In this study, we evaluated the effects of wogonin on H2O2-induced vascular permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that wogonin can suppress the H2O2-stimulated actin remodeling and albumin uptake of HUVECs, as well as transendothelial cell migration of the human breast carcinoma cell MDA-MB-231. The mechanism revealed that wogonin inhibited H2O2-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (cav-1) associating with the suppression of stabilization of VE-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. Moreover, wogonin repressed anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of p38, cav-1 and vascular permeability. These results suggested that wogonin could inhibit H2O2-induced vascular permeability by downregulating the phosphorylation of cav-1, and that it might have a therapeutic potential for the diseases associated with the development of both oxidant and vascular permeability.",

We searched for inhibitors of HDC from the ethyl acetate extract of the petal of Filipendula ulmaria, also called meadowsweet. Rugosin D, rugosin A, rugosin A methyl ester (a novel compound), and tellimagrandin II were the main components; these 4 ellagitannins exhibited a non-competitive type of inhibition, with K(i) values of approximately 0.35-1 \u03bcM. These K(i) values are nearly equal to that of histidine methyl ester (K(i)=0.46 \u03bcM), an existing substrate analogue inhibitor.

Treatment with CAPE decreased protein abundance of Akt, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, phospho-Akt Ser473, phospho-Akt Thr 308, GSK3\u03b2, FOXO1, FOXO3a, phospho-FOXO1 Thr24, phospho-FoxO3a Thr32, NF-\u03baB, phospho-NF-\u03baB Ser536, Rb, phospho-Rb Ser807/811, Skp2, and cyclin D1, but increased cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Overexpression of Akt1 or Akt2 in TW2.6 cells rescued growth inhibition caused by CAPE treatment. Co-treating TW2.6 cells with CAPE and 5-fluorouracil, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug for oral cancers, exhibited additive cell proliferation inhibition. Our study suggested that administration of CAPE is a potential adjuvant therapy for patients with OSCC oral cancer.",

We searched ER\u03b1 cistromes of MCF-7 breast cancer cells for previously unrecognized ER\u03b1 targets and identified proto-oncogene PIM-1 as a novel potential target gene. We show that the expression of PIM-1 is induced in response to estradiol in MCF-7 cells and that the induction is mediated by ER\u03b1-regulated enhancers located distally upstream from the gene. In keeping with the growth-promoting role of the PIM-1, depletion of the PIM-1 attenuated the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells, which was paralleled with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor CDKN1A and CDKN2B expression. Analysis of PIM-1 expression between invasive breast tumors and benign breast tissue samples showed that elevated PIM-1 expression is associated with malignancy and a higher tumor grade. In sum, identification of PIM-1 as an ER\u03b1 target gene adds a novel potential mechanism by which estrogens can contribute to breast cancer cell proliferation and carcinogenesis.",

The distribution pattern of Fos induced by amantadine was more similar to those seen with dopaminomimetics than with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Pretreatment with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390, and the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, blocked amantadine induction of Fos in the striatum. However, amantadine induction of Fos in the striatum was unaffected by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride.

Due to its immunosuppressive properties, the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has become a promising target in the experimental treatment of human malignant gliomas. Here, we report that the antifibrotic drug 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone (pirfenidone, PFD) elicits growth-inhibitory effects and reduces TGF-beta2 protein levels in human glioma cell lines. This reduction in TGF-beta2 is biologically relevant since PFD treatment reduces the growth inhibition of TGF-beta-sensitive CCL-64 cells mediated by conditioned media of glioma cells. The downregulation of TGF-beta is mediated at multiple levels. PFD leads to a reduction of TGF-beta2 mRNA levels and of the mature TGF-beta2 protein due to decreased expression and direct inhibition of the TGF-beta pro-protein convertase furin. In addition, PFD reduces the protein levels of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-11, a TGF-beta target gene and furin substrate involved in carcinogenesis. These data define PFD or PFD-related agents as promising agents for human cancers associated with enhanced TGF-beta activity.",
